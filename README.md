# Data-Analysis-Project

	I'm excited to share with you my latest project - an insight report to the hotel revenue team!  📊
	Using the data visualization capabilities of Power BI, I analyzed various aspects of hotel revenue. 
  This report provides insight into the hospitality industry, with interactive charts to help you filter and explore the data yourself.
  During the development of this report, it helped me a lot in analyzing data, transforming it using Power Query, creating metrics, calculated and conditional columns using DAX.
	The report uses interactive visualization and data modeling to make complex datasets easier to understand and explore.
  With just a few clicks, you can drill down, drill, and page through to specific data points, and identify trends, patterns, and correlations that might otherwise be difficult to see.

Here are the steps I followed to create this dashboard:
	Before starting to create this dashboard, I first researched/collected the KPIs of the hospitality industry.
	Connect to the data source, .CSV data, and import the data into Power Bi Desktop in import mode.
	Perform data transformations using Power Query and DAX and create data modelling relationships between tables using star schemas.
	Create a variety of visualizations, such as charts, tables, and cards, to present data in meaningful ways.
  Use custom conditional formatting icons for better user experience.
